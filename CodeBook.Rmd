## Files

This repository contains 5 R coding files and 4 png vector files  

1) readdata.R - A comprehensive R coding file dictating how the data was preprocessed prior to plot generation  

### Plotting files  
**All plotting files also contain the R code to process the original raw data**

2) plot1.R - code to generate Global Active Power histogram  
3) plot2.R - code to generate Global Active Power useage line graph  
4) plot3.R - code to generate Energy Sub Metering line graph  
5) plot4.R - code to generate 2x2 plot matrix of multiple plots

### Vector files
**Vector .png files are the output of the previous R coding files**
1) plot1.png - Global Active Power Frequency Histogram  
2) plot2.png - Global Active Power Useage Line Graph  
3) plot3.png - Energy Sub Metering Line Graph  
4) plot4.png - 2x2 Matrix with multiple plots

## Data Transformation
Initially, our working directory was checked for an existing directory "./data". If that didn't exist, it was created to store our raw data. Data was accessed from the URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip. This data was then unzipped and stored in a folder titled "UnzipedData". Data was then read into R using data.table with sep=";" and NA values represented as "?". Skipping 1 line for headers.
